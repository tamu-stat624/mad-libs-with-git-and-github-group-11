Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Jack Sparrow,

I am writing to you from a helpless spaceship in a cruel galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a red rocket in November. There are [6] [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of soda. I fall asleep each night on a flawless bed of
leather and dream of dancing quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for 1000 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is dancing on a sleek spaceship!!

Best wishes,
Pragati N
